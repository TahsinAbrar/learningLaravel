#Learning Laravel - ToDo App

[![](http://laravel.com/assets/img/logo-head.png)](http://laravel.com)

###### I've been developing this To-Do App for learning Laravel Framework. I followed the book: ***["Learning Laravel The Easiest Way"](http://learninglaravel.net/)*** by *Jack Vo*.


I think, this is the best laravel learning book for the beginners.


Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. And I'm trying hard to become a Happy developer. :bowtie:
